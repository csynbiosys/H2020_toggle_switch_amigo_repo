function [] = Run_fit_to_M1( resultBase, numExperiments )
% This function runs the script for the identification of the model structure
% we propose to describe the Toggle switch to the experimental data published in Lugagne et al., 2017.
% The dataset includes 26 experiments (6 calibration+20 control). Inconsistencies noted in the original repository of
% the paper have been addressed through private communication with the
% authors and corrected accordingly. Parameter estimation is performed
% using crossvalidation. To this end we split the data between training set
% (17 randomised experiments)and test (9 experiments) set. SSE is computed
% over the test set to select the best parameter estimates. 
% It takes two inputs:
% - a string with the identifier of the output files
% - the number of iterations of parameter estimation. 
% In the paper we used numExperiments = 100.
